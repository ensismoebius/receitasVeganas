Tahini Recipe
150 gr (5,3 oz, 1 cup) raw sesame seeds
3 tablespoons hazelnut oil

• Warm 150 gr raw sesame seeds in a large steel pan. Just warming every sesame seed will be enough for making tahini. Don’t roast them until all of it turns to brown. Using a steel pan is important as it has no coating, not releasing harmful gases at high temperatures. You can use a cast iron pan as well for browning.
• Add the sesame seeds in food processor while they are still hot.
• Pulse for about a minute and add 3 tablespoons of hazelnut oil. You can use grape seed oil or sunflower oil as well but prefer a seed oil then olive oil for this recipe.
• After working food processor for another 3 minutes your tahini will be ready to enjoy. First the texture is going to be sand-like. Don’t give up on that stage and continue. After enough patience your tahini is going to be creamy and dreamy.
